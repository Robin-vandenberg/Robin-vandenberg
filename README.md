- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robin van den Berg (robinofskii)

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things webdevelopment. The last two years I've been professionally involved with Angular and React (using NextJS), but on the side I've been broadening my horizons. I've dabbled with some React-native and wrote my own API in NodeJS. This, because I believe it's important to know all facets of the job, if you want to do it right.
