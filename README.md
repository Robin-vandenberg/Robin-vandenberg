- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Robin-vandenberg,
Student ICT & Media Design @Fontys Hogescholen in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things webdevelopment. The last two years I've been professionally involved with Angular, but on the side I've been broadening my horizons. I've dabbled with some React and wrote my own API in NodeJS. This, because I believe it's important to know all facets of the job, if you want to do it right.
